### gRPC Server Methods ("Services")

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `isReady` | Check if this microservice is ready to receive gRPC requests. |
| `updateVertiports` | Add or update vertiports in the database. |
| `updateWaypoints` | Add or update waypoints in the database. |
| `updateZones` | Add or update no fly zones in the database. |
| `updateAircraftPosition` | Add or update the position of aircraft in the database. |
| `bestPath` | Get the shortest path between two nodes. Currently supported is vertiport to vertiport and aircraft to vertiport routing. |
| `nearestNeighbors` | Gets the nearest vertiport neighbors to an aircraft or vertiport. |

### gRPC Client Messages ("Requests")

gRPC interfaces will be autogenerated in release four.
